    "text": "Professional Journey\n\nCurrent Role at Boeing\nSince December 2021, I’ve been with The Boeing Company in Seattle, where I’ve taken on progressively responsible roles:\nBCA Procurement Agent – Contract Negotiation Support / Aftermarket Deal Team (May 2024 – Present)\nIn my current position, I review BCA Supply Chain contracting activities to assess their impact on various Aftermarket stakeholders. I’ve developed and now lead an aftermarket coordination process that influences supplier negotiations, ensuring all parties align with strategic objectives. My work involves engaging with program leadership across BCA Supply Chain and aftermarket divisions to capture the best value for Boeing.\nBGS Procurement Agent – Business Strategy (January 2023 – May 2024)\nI focused on supplier development and relationship management to meet strategic business objectives. I identified business and customer pain points and developed targeted strategies to address them. A key achievement was developing a letter agreement alongside the BCA functional excellence team that enabled BGS simplified ordering while protecting BCA interests.\nBGS Compliance & Risk Management Team (November 2023 – February 2024)\nDuring a four-month loan to this team, I completed 517 unique customer requests related to EU/UK Sanctions—representing 62% of all requests during that period. I also supported the resolution of FAA Undue Burden compliance issues across BGS suppliers.\nBGS Transportation Analyst (December 2021 – January 2023)\nAs the primary transportation focal, I led logistics operations for the 767BCF and 737BCF programs. Through strategic consolidation processes, I prevented approximately $250,000 in additional transportation costs over 10 months without compromising delivery deadlines.\n\n\nPrior Experience\nBefore joining Boeing, I built a strong foundation in freight forwarding and logistics operations:\n\nDSV Air & Sea Inc. – Freight Forwarder, where I secured a healthcare customer worth $400,000 in incremental revenue and maintained a 100% acceptance rate for dangerous goods shipments\nLufthansa Technik Component Services – Supervisor of Transport Operations, where I improved dangerous goods airline acceptance from 70% to 99% and led teams to achieve 90% on-time performance for AOG requirements\nDB Schenker – Senior Air Export Coordinator supporting Boeing’s expedited shipments\nSwissport Cargo Services – Cargo Agent and Lead Screener ensuring TSA and IATA regulatory compliance"
